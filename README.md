# electron-svelte

> An electron-svelte boilerplate greatly inspired by [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue)@[4c6ee7b](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue/tree/4c6ee7bf4f9b4aa647a22ec1c1ca29c2e59c3645) (using all the scripts)
 
There are no testing libraries yet, because i am not using them (for now).
I haven't tested everything electron-vue can do but i guess it should work.
#### Check out the detailed documentation [here](https://simulatedgreg.gitbooks.io/electron-vue/content/index.html).
